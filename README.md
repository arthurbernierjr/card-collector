## About:
A website where you can index your Pokemon card collection into a digital catalog.

## Getting started:
You can use the application/website by clicking [this link]()
+ Click Sign-Up, if you're a first time user, and create a username and password.
+ Then sign-in and add your first card!
+ Input the details of the card: Pokemon name, type, and condition. Not required, but the collector number from the card is also an available field.
+ And voila, the card is added to "My Collection" where you can see all of your cards.

## Technologies Used:
To write my application I utilized these languages and associated libraries:
+ Front-end languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
+ Back-end: Node.js, Express, and EJS for templating.
+ MongoDB for database.
+ 
+ 
+ 

## Future updates, coming soon:
+ Support for other classifications of Pokemon cards (Trainer and Energy).
+ Support for evaluation of the card's current market value.
